Sign up for a Render Account: Visit the Render website (render.com) and sign up for an account. Render offers a free tier with limitations, making it a viable option for getting started.

Create a New Web Service: Once you're signed in to Render, create a new web service for your webhook server. Render supports several programming languages and frameworks, so choose the appropriate option for your webhook server.

Configure Your Web Service: Set up the necessary configuration for your webhook server. This includes specifying the deployment source (e.g., GitHub repository), choosing the desired infrastructure (e.g., cloud provider, region), and defining any environment variables or dependencies required by your server.

Define the Webhook Endpoint: Write the code for your webhook server, defining the endpoint that will receive incoming webhook requests. The specifics will depend on your chosen programming language and framework.

Deploy Your Webhook Server: Once your webhook server code is ready, deploy it to Render by connecting your code repository or uploading your code directly. Render will handle the build and deployment process for you.

Configure Webhook URL in TradingView: In TradingView, configure the webhook alert to target the URL provided by Render for your webhook server. This ensures that TradingView sends the webhook requests to your server hosted on Render.

Monitor and Scale: Monitor the logs and behavior of your webhook server on Render. Render provides scaling options, allowing you to handle increased traffic as your bot gains popularity or your needs grow.
